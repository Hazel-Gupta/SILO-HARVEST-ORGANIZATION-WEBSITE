      <h1 class="w3-center">About SILOS</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">The modern way to store produce</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">A silo is a structure for storing bulk materials. Silos are used in agriculture to store grain (see grain elevators) or fermented feed known as silage. Silos are commonly used for bulk storage of grain, coal, cement, carbon black, woodchips, food products and sawdust. Three types of silos are in widespread use today: tower silos, bunker silos, and bag silos.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The advantages of Silos are: <br>
          <li class="w3-large">Large Storage Capacity</li>
          <li class="w3-large">Long-term solution</li>
          <li class="w3-large">Low running costs</li>
          <li class="w3-large">Low labour requirement</li>
          <li class="w3-large">Low wastage</li>
          <li class="w3-large">Saves time </li>

      <p class="w3-large">DEMAND SUPPLY GAP<br>
          Since India has a large number of farmers, there is a huge demand and supply gap in the production of food. Most farmers have no storage facilities and produce the same crop at the same time. Farmers sell all their produce of the same kind at the same time. As a result, the market becomes saturated and the prices drop. Since farmers have to sell all their produce, they get less money, and therefore remain in poverty. They have to sell their produce at the market price and are therefore are not able to earn the full amount.<br>Â 
          In the past 14 years, 72.23% of what and 68.7% of rice were not procured by FCI/state agencies and were sold below the Minimum Support Price (MSP).<br>
        Indian farmers mostly use cold storages to store their produce. There are about 37,254,097 cold storages in India as of 31 Aug, 2020. However, 82.6% of farmers do have acmes to these facilities and only 13.8% farmers have the access. Out of these 82.65 farmers, most of them have small and medium sized holdings which do not produce enough money to invest in storage facilities. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Our Plan</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large">The main goal of this proposal is to dredge the demand-supply gap in the production of food grains by providing efficient and long term storage facilities to not only the large sized farmers, but also the small and medium sized farmers who do not have access to these resources.<br>

          The proposal is to create an organization which will provide Silos. It will work in accordance with the government of India and will be aimed to increase the number of efficient and effective storage facilities in the country. This organization will keep track of all farmers and Silos and ensure the minimum wastage of produce.  The organization will also ensure the maintenance and repairs of the Silos, whose funds will also provided by the government of India. <br>

          Each area which produces a certain amount of harvest will be provided a Silo. This can be a single Silo in one district or even a single Silo, pooled by many districts. Farmers will harvest their produce individually, but will pool their produce and store it in the common Silo. Farmers will not pay to store their produce. However, certain terms and conditions will e set on the amount and time limit.<br>
